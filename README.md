# Huffman Tree Project

### The Project
This project was the final exam of the Data Structure discipline, taught by Professor MÃ¡rcio Ribeiro, of the Computer Engineering course at the Federal University of Alagoas (Brazil) in 2018.

The aim was to make good use of learned data structures. Our group used the **C language** for the program, Huffman **tree depth test**, unit test with **CUnit**, **R plot** of the structure data and a **seminar** about Btree.
